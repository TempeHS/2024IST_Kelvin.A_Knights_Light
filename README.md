# What I intended to make
<p>What I had originally intended to make was a more complex game with a added QTE (Quick Time Event) Enemy killing system. The game originally was suppose to target racism, but with limited time the features to implement this idea was not reached as focuses on core components of the game was more key to the time, such things as movement, a monster system, vfx and shaders.</p>

# What I had made
<p>The game which I had made is a simple platformer wiht simple features, I made the game visually appealing through use of **lighting, shadows, shaders and post-processing** in order to create more depth visually</p>
