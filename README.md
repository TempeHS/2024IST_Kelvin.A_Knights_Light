## Quick Demonstration & Gameplay

[Gameplay Demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3b530ec-3bd9-42b2-b68c-0a961a1a589b)

## Overview

<p align="justify">
This game was developed as a project for an assessment, initially meant to adhere to the theme "Games for Change," though it ultimately diverged from that goal. In the game, you control a knight wielding a special light that illuminates the path ahead. As you navigate through various challenges, such as falling platforms and goblins, the increasing difficulty ensures the game remains engaging. The use of bloom, lighting, and shadows plays a crucial role, with light being a key visual element. Unfortunately, the project remains incomplete.
